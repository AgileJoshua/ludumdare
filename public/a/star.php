// Stars are Favourites or Bookmarks. If you want to remember/save something, you Star it.
// Stars belong only to users (UID>0). You cannot Star if you are not logged in.

// Potential Exploits:
// - Multiple User Accounts

// Unlike Love, Stars will be more dynamic. Users will favourite (bookmark) things they want
//   to see later, and unfavourite once they finish. This wont be true for all users, but
//   I just want to point out it is something we will see that we wont see as much in Love.
// Speaking of "Magic", in the early days of scoring, it may be worth considering making 
//   Stars worth 2 or 3 points, and Love worth 1 point. This doesn't solve the Multiple Account
//   exploit, but it ensure that opinions of users are worth more than anyonymous people.
// To be clear: Scoring here is a sorting score, not a rating. It's how we decide to prioritize.
