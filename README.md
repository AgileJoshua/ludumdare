ludumdare.com
=============

The new Ludum Dare website (codename: Starship, formerly LD2015).

The code is not live on ludumdare.com, but instead here:

https://ldjam.com

This snapshot isn't necessarily the latest version, but something deemed stable enough to push to the live server for testing.

Other Ludum Dare service URLs:

* https://static.ldjam.org - static content
* https://pusher.ldjam.com - uploads
* https://api.ldjam.org/v1/ - Ludum Dare API
* https://ldj.am - ludumdare.com URL shortener
* https://jammer.bio - Jammer Bios
* https://jammer.tv - Jammer TV
* https://jam.host - Jam Hosting

Things we can't test locally using DairyBox: Cloudflare/CDN features, HTTPS, email (?).

Once it matures, portions of this code may eventually become the LD-CMW project.
