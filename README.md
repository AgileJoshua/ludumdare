=============

The new Ludum Dare website (codename: Starship, formerly LD2015).

The code is not yet live, but a WIP snapshot can be viewed here:

https://wip.ludumdare.com

This snapshot isn't necessarily the latest version, but something deemed stable enough to push to the live server for testing.

Other WIP Ludum Dare service URLs:

* https://static-wip.ludumdare.com - static content
* https://wip.jammer.bio - Jammer
* https://wip.ludumdare.tv - LDtv standalone
* http://wip.ldj.am - ludumdare.com URL shortener

Things we can't test locally using DairyBox: Cloudflare/CDN features, HTTPS, email (?).

Once it matures, portions of this code may eventually become the LD-CMW project.
