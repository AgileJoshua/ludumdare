=============

The new Ludum Dare website (codename: Starship, formerly LD2015).

This is the LIVE WEBSITE code, as customized for ludumdare.com by Mike and the Ludum Dare web team. 

The code is not yet live, but a WIP snapshot can be viewed here:

https://wip.ludumdare.com

This snapshot isn't necessarily the latest version, but something deemed stable enough to push to the live server for testing.

Things we can't test locally using DairyBox: Cloudflare/CDN features, HTTPS, email (?).

Once it matures, portions of this code may eventually become the LD-CMW project.
